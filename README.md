# sd-artists-wildcards

Artist wildcard text files split by category according to Automatic1111's csv file.

Use with [Jtkelm2's Wildcards script](https://github.com/jtkelm2/stable-diffusion-webui-1/blob/master/scripts/wildcards.py) to generate dynamic prompts on the fly.  
For more wildcard files check out my [stable-soup repo](https://github.com/Lopyter/stable-soup-prompts) which also contains insallation instructions for the script.

Categories should be mostly self-explanatory.

Explanation for "digipa", "c" and "n" categories as per Automatic1111 on Discord:

> digipa is digital painting, split into low, medium and high impact - depending on how strongly the artist's name affects the output  
> it's split because there are so many of them  
> c and n are no comment  
>misclassified
